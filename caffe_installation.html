<h1>An idiot's guide to install Caffe with gpu-support in Ubuntu-16.04</h1>

<h2>Step-1 Install latest Nvidia-graphics driver</h2>
<p>
One nice working method is to do this in Ubuntu is to install via Additional Driver option in Software Settings.
</p>

<h2>Step-2 Change default gcc version to 4.8 or 4.9</h2>
<p>

<h2>Step-3 Install CUDA-8.0</h2>
<p>
Among many options available I prefer using local installation via .deb package as follow:-
<div><em>
sudo dpkg -i cuda****.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cuda</em>
</div>
After installation add Cuda to path of the system.
To do this open .bashrc file in home directory with admin privileges and in the end of the file append following:-
<div>
<em>
xport CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-8.0
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/lib64 
PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/bin:${PATH} 
export PATH
</em>

</div>
Reopen the terminal and check the installation of cuda by running following command in terminal:-
<div>
<em> nvcc -v </em>
</div>
</p>
<hr>


<h2>Step-4 Install Nvidia's CuDNN deep learning library</h2>
<p>
Go to nvidia's site and login with developer account(if you don't have it by now,then make one). 
Download CuDNN version 5.1 for Cuda-8.0
Extract the .tgz and copy content inside it to Cuda directories as follow:-
<div>
<em>
sudo cp -P include/cudnn.h /usr/include
sudo cp -P lib64/libcudnn* /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
sudo chmod a+r /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn*
</em>
</div>
</p>
<hr>


<h2>Step-5 Install various dependencies</h2>
<p>
Several packages are required for installing Caffe. They are listed at <a href = "http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html">official site of Caffe</a>.

<h2>Step-6 Here comes the trick part</h2>
<p>


</p>
<hr>


<h2>Step-7 Download Caffe</h2>
<p>



</p>
<hr>


<h2>Step-8 Wait! Do you need a Makefile?</h2>
<p>

</div>

</p>
<hr>


<h2>Step-9 Compile</h2>
<p>
Go to ~/caffe/ and execute following commands-
<div>
<em>
make all
make test
make runtest
make pycaffe
</em>

</div>

</p>
<hr>


<h2>Step-10 Add Python path</h2>
<p>
Again open our beloved .bashrc with admin privileges and append following:-
<div>
<em>

</em>
</div>
</p>
<hr>


<h2>Tasting the Caffe</h2>
<p>
Open python interpreter or jupyter notebook and run
<div>
<em>
import caffe
</em>
</div>
If you don't get any error messages, I believe you are as lucky as I am and you Caffe is brewed well. A good enough reason to celebrate. Cheers!!!
