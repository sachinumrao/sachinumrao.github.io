			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<hr>
			Hello folks! My name is Sachin Umrao. I am a fifth year dual-degree student in Mechanical Engineering Department at IIT Kanpur.
			I am interested in <em>Deep Learning</em> and Machine Learning in general. This website is a way for me to reorganize whatever I learn. 
			So, I will be posting various stuff as I learn it. If you find anything helpful, that is, just a coincident.
