		<h1>Using Virtual Environment in Python</h1>
		<hr>
		
		<p>While doing development sometimes we need to test our codes compatibility
		with different libraries. Such as when I create a machine learning model in 
		Tensorflow, I verify if its working with cpu version and gpu version of library.
		Hence, I need to maintain two different versions of environments in python.
		Some people use "conda" but I am not much of a fan of conda and like to keep 
		things as simple as they can be.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p><b> virutalenv </b> is a python virtual environment manager. We can install it 
		by following command.</p>
		
		<div class='code'><em>
		pip install virtualenv</em>
		<br>
		(OR)
		<br>
		<em>
		sudo pip install virtualenv
		</em>
		
		</div>
		
		<p> Lets say we want to make two environments "Deep_CPU" and "Deep_GPU".
